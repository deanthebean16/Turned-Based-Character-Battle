# MAPHEAN - Turn Based Character Battle Game



## Project Overview
Maphean is a web-based, turn-based combat RPG built with a focus on procedural logic and dynamic UI. The game utilizes HTML5 and CSS3 for a responsive battle interface, while the core engine is driven by JavaScript.

A central feature of Maphean is its probability-based mechanics, which govern everything from character summons to critical hit ratios and parry accuracy, ensuring every encounter requires both strategy and a bit of luck.
