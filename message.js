                            -CHARACTER-
To choose a character, click the button in the top right corner, this will bring you to the Gacha page where you can roll for a specific character. Here are the rates:
S tier characters: 5%, chance
A tier characters: 10%, chance
B tier characters 35%, chance
C tier characters: 50%, chance


                            -BATTLE-
Once you have picked a character, you can now step into the arena! The fight is turn-based and you start. There are two options to pick during your tuen: Attack and Parry. Attack: Has a chance to deal damage equal to your ATK at a chance of your HIT%. Parry: Has a chance to block your opponents incoming damage for your own ATK, and also sets it to your turn again. Note though that parry will be ___ on both your PARRY% and the opponents HIT%, and the chance will be much lower. Once you have beaten all opponents, you will be able to see the ending...
