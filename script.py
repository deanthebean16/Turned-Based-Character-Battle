"Welcome to Maphean- a game that integrates fighting and gambling. Once players have loaded into the game they can get characters by using the gacha option. Once they have a character they are satisfied with, they can use them to enter the Colosseum! To win you will have to beat all the opponents that stand before you in turn based combat and become champion! If you lose, do not fret, you can always try again!"
